# Backgrounder
The environmental damage caused by illegal activities has become a pressing global issue that needs urgent attention. Illegal activities in the environment include unauthorized mining, wildlife poaching, and uncontrolled deforestation. The negative impacts of these activities include habitat destruction, loss of biodiversity, soil degradation, water pollution, and climate change (Smith et al., 2019). Furthermore, illegal activities also affect the livelihoods of local communities dependent on threatened natural resources (Sundström et al., 2020).

Illegal mining is one of the forms of illegal activities that poses a serious challenge that needs to be addressed quickly. In addressing this challenge, NatureVision emerges as an innovative solution. By utilizing audio and satellite imagery technology, this application can monitor large areas with high accuracy. The existence of the NatureVision application, based on audio and satellite imagery data, offers new hope in the effort to monitor and detect illegal mining activities early (Li et al., 2021). Furthermore, this application can also identify suspicious behavioral patterns, providing an opportunity for authorities to take action before further damage occurs (Wang et al., 2020). In this essay, we will explore the benefits and potential uses of the NatureVision application in combating illegal activities in the environment, especially illegal mining.
